# FISH
![alt text](https://ibb.co/S01Lrvt)

Welcome to Fish, a symptom tracking and medication reminder application, currently in Beta Testing for the App Store. In this app you can monitor one time or recurring symptoms, see symptom history over time, track medication usage, and recieve notifications as to when to take your next medication. 

Note: although this app is written in React Native, it is currently only optimized for iPhones, not Android devices.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local device for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You must have npm installed on your computer. If you have a Macbook, you can run the app through Expo on the XCode iOS Simulator. Otherwise, you can download the Expo app on your mobile device and register an account. 

You should also have the Expo Cli. Assuming that you have Node installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

### Installing

First clone the project and install the packages needed for the application:
```
npm install
```

To start the app, run

```
expo start
```
This should open a browser that loads a QR Code. Assuming you are using a physical iPhone, scan the QR code with your camera, and the Expo App will open up with Fish running. If you are using the simulator, TODO://how
